            <p>Earth: It’s like… something inside me is breaking.
                Slowly. Quietly. And no one seems to notice.</p>
            <p>Doctor: I notice. And I’m listening. When did you first start feeling this way? </p>

            <p>Earth: I don’t know exactly. It crept in… like a slow fever. First it was small things. Then it became
                everything. It started with small aches… like bruises I couldn’t explain.</p>
            <p>Earth: The forests thinned, the oceans grew heavy.
                The air, once light and sweet, turned thick, like smoke trapped in my lungs.</p>
            <p>At first, I thought it
                would pass. That it was just a season. But it kept growing. And every time I cried out, they called it
                weather. Every time I trembled, they built stronger walls.</p>
            <p>And now… now it feels like I’m losing parts
                of myself faster than I can hold them together. </p>
            <p>Doctor: It’s completely normal to feel this way under stress. You’re experiencing a temporary instability
                — nothing more. These fluctuations happen naturally. Our responsibility is to maintain appearances — …I
                mean, to ensure your recovery is properly supported.</p>

            <p>Earth: You’re not here to heal me. You’re here to make sure no one sees how sick I’ve become.</p>

            <p>Doctor: ou’ve always had periods like this. You just don’t remember it clearly.</p>

            <p>It didn’t use to be like this.</p>
            <p>There was…warmth. Laughter in the rivers.</p>
            <p>Strength in the forests.</p>
            <p>The skies... they used to breathe with me… </p>
            <p>…not choke me.</p>
            <p>But somewhere along the way... the air grew thinner.</p>
            <p>The ground colder.</p>
            <p>The rivers
                quieter.</p>
            <p>You told me it was normal. You told me it was natural. Temporary instability. Phases. Cycles.
                Seasons.</p>

            <P>I gave everything freely once.</P>
            <p>Stone, water, air, flame — it was meant to be shared.</p>
            <p>Taken with care,
                given with thanks.</p>
            <p>But they forgot how to ask. They forgot how to listen.</P>
            <P>And when they built their engines, when they learned to turn fire into power, they stopped seeing me at
                all.</P>
            <p>They fed the fire until it swallowed the skies, and called it progress.</P>
            <P>They silenced the winds to build their towers, and called it ambition.</P>
            <P>They burned the forests to light their cities, and called it triumph.</P>
            <p>They drained the oceans to fill their engines, and called it discovery.</P>
            <P>They pulled and tore, faster and deeper, turning blood into profit, bones into monuments, until the sky
                turned hollow.</P>
